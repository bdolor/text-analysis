Change is an integral part of our organization, and it is accepted; as long as it is meaningful, and hopefully lasting for a period.","Embracing innovation as a word, but in practice falls short. Many within greater Government of Canada tend to be risk averse, and too focused on process, which stunts growth and innovation.","Shared Services Canada has lead for providing cloud infrastructure; IT engineers in DND still seem to be learning how to best use cloud computing infrastructure. Overall there seems to be higher-level Government support, with risk averse questions, asking whether there are potential issues with regards to where the data is stored (must be in Canada).","Federal Government of Canada is expected to keep up with society and technological innovation, therefore, we are expected to be more efficient in using taxpayers' money. We are expected to innovate and be more efficient, constantly.","Barely adequate. Seemingly far behind on work tickets and integrating new technologies. Not sure if it is from lack of human resources, or inefficient use of them.","Not strong at all, because we have not fully adopted it yet. Nascent.","Again, more reliable, more redundant services, faster (hopefully). ","For day-to-day office work, could greatly enhance operations. However, when military personnel are deployed in distance parts of the world, it would likely have no impact, no help. Might even be a detriment if very remote / high latency data connection is dependent on cloud services hosted in Canada. Need remote servers and systems set up, close to remote sites.","Related to cloud computing, we had a Thin Client (Virtually Hosted Desktop) trial that went straight into implementation. Many thin clients were deployed, dependant on all the desktops hosted in ""the cloud"", and the service was horrible. As a result of fielding this capability without upgrading the network infrastructure, many end users saw thin clients and aggregating computing power remotely as a failure. Need to consider the whole capability and project before launching (as always)."

More focus on the Business Application rather than the platform it runs on.","I believe it would align very well, since over time the strategic plan is to move away from premise technology to cloud technology and focus on Application Business Support to all business groups with the municipality.","One constraining barrier could to the cost to move to a full cloud infrastructure, but if the benefits and long term saving can be communicated to leadership then the journey could be adopted sooner."
